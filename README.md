# PHP Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: using loose comparison (==) instead of strict comparison (===).  The `bug.php` file contains a function that incorrectly uses loose comparison, leading to unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version of the function.
